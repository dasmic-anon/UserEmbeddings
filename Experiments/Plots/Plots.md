Plots:

Data Source

1. Number of tools in each MCP server
2. Number of sessions for each user (Histogram)
3. Total calls for each tool (min-max)

Computed plots

For each embedding dimension:
  For each algorithm:
        1. Canary Data - Euclidean and Cosine distance between each user pair (points)
        2. Euclidean and Cosine sim. between each user pair (Histogram) 
        3. PCA plots for each user embedding
        4. User Clusters on euclidean and cosine distance
